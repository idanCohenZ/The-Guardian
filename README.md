<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

### About The Project 👨‍👩‍👧

The client side is built using React.js and was fully desinged by us. (Myself and my collaborator Idan Cohen Zada). It consists of a grand Homepage, a Login page, statistics page which reflects the major vulnerabilities our system inferred from the user's Instagram's account and later directs the user to focused results: compromised locations. Close cycle of friends and family. Patterns, lables and categories that the user might be closely involved with such as: a smoker, nature lover, musician, extolling army service etc.
